# catalog

**File:** `desk/src/catalog.zig`  
**Module:** `desk`  
**Description:** The desk's view of the model catalog + the deploy option sets — the provider/model list is re-exported from `modelcfg` (comptime-parsed models.yaml, the same source the server reads), and only the desk-specific pieces live here.

---

## Purpose Summary

This file no longer hand-writes a provider/model table. `modelcfg` comptime-parses the repo-root `models.yaml` — the SAME source the server reads — and this module re-exports its types and data so every desk menu (chat Settings, Swarm deploy, Tasks model override) and the server stay in lockstep: edit models.yaml, rebuild, everything updates. What remains desk-specific is `resolveBase()` (the `{account}` substitution the desk performs before sending a base_url) and the deploy option sets (styles / stacks / modes / minutes), which are workflow knobs, not models.

## Key Exports

- `Model`, `Provider` — re-exports of the `modelcfg` types
- `Tier`, `ModelSense`, `senseModel` — model capacity sensing (params/ctx/tier from yaml metadata or the model id); the desk keys its prompt variant + per-section budgets off this (see chat.zig `budgetFor`)
- `providers` — THE provider list, a comptime slice from models.yaml; array-style access (`providers[i]`, `.len`, `for`) works exactly as the old in-file array did
- `defaults` — the local + Cloudflare model defaults from models.yaml, for the "no model chosen" fallbacks
- `DEPLOY_MENU_ROWS` (32), `CHAT_MENU_ROWS` (64), `TASKS_MENU_ROWS` (128) — the row capacity of the fixed stack arrays `main.zig` builds the Swarm deploy, Settings and Tasks model menus into. A `comptime` block refuses to compile a catalog that outgrows any of them (a provider with too many models, too many providers, or too many models overall for the flat Tasks menu), in every desk build rather than only under `zig build test` — Settings and Tasks would otherwise silently drop the providers listed last, and the deploy menu would write past its array. `scripts/sync-models.py` grows the catalog daily inside these limits
- `resolveBase(p, account, out)` — substitute the account id into a `{account}`-templated base_url (Cloudflare Workers AI) using the caller's buffer; with no account id (or when the result won't fit) returns the `"cloudflare"` sentinel so the server falls back to its own configured Workers AI credentials; non-templated URLs pass through untouched
- `styles` (`auto`/`build`/`build_use`/`investigate`/`debate`), `stacks` (`general`/`static`/`node`), `modes` (`continuous`/`checkpoint`/`refine`/`cast`), `minutes` / `minutes_lbl` (0 = "until stopped")

## Dependencies

- `modelcfg` — the shared comptime models.yaml module (the catalog's single source of truth)
- `log.zig` — trace logging in `resolveBase`

## Usage Context

`main.zig` drives every provider/model dropdown and the Deploy form off `providers`/`styles`/`modes`/`minutes`, calls `resolveBase` to produce the base_url actually sent, and falls back to `defaults.local_model`; `chat.zig` selects prompt tiers via `senseModel`. `store.zig` persists BYOK selections as indices into `providers`, so the yaml's provider order is part of the persisted-settings contract.

## Notable Implementation Details

- The catalog is compiled in, but from models.yaml rather than a hand-maintained array — the old in-file provider table is gone, and desk/server drift is structurally impossible while both build from the same yaml.
- `resolveBase` never allocates: it memcpy's pre + trimmed account + post into the caller-supplied `out` and returns a slice of it. Its two fallbacks both return the literal `"cloudflare"` — no account id, or the substituted URL would overflow `out` — meaning "let the server use its included/env Workers AI creds".
- `"cast"` is documented in-file as the fast scatter-gather mode: the lead decomposes the goal, each mind runs ONE moment on its slice (~1–2 min), and the result is synthesized — vs `"continuous"`, which loops for the whole budget.
